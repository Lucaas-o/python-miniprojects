## Tips for Success
- **Schedule Consistency**: Dedicate 10-15 hours/week, adjusting based on availability. Use a calendar to track video sessions, exercises, and project deadlines.
- **Project Documentation**: Create a README for each project with what you learned, challenges faced, and solutions to reflect and improve.
- **Community Engagement**: Share progress on GitHub, join Python communities (e.g., Reddit’s r/learnpython), and ask questions.
- **Iterative Learning**: Revisit earlier concepts (e.g., file I/O) as needed for advanced projects (e.g., AI data preprocessing).
- **Burnout Prevention**: Take 1-2 week breaks between milestones to avoid fatigue over the 4.5-year journey.

This program provides a structured path to deeply learn Python across all domains by August 31, 2029. Adjust the schedule or resources as needed based on your progress!
